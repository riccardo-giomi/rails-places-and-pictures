# Places and Pictures

An application created as an exercise, it allows to save places selected from a
map and upload pictures which will be associated with the place the picture was
taken.

It will Start from a "normal" Rails application created with my
[quickstart template](https://github.com/riccardo-giomi/rails-7.1-quickstart),
and made into a Hotwire application.

For the map and its interface the application uses
[Lefleat](https://leafletjs.com/) and
[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org).
